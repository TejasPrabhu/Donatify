This project is an extension of the previous work : [Donatify](https://agupta15k.github.io/ncsu_se_fall22_22_pr_1/)

The gift of giving always comes full circle. Giving and receiving go hand in hand, and being generous is a selfless act. F feeling good about contributing is one of the main benefits of giving. Giving back to people in need allows you to grow personally and gives you a higher sense of fulfillment. It also makes you feel good to serve others. You may donate that extra food or that unused item to someone in need rather than throwing it trash or stashing it at the back of the storehouse. Knowing that you're contributing much-needed resources to a worthwhile cause for those in need gives you a sense of self-worth. You and your loved one will also feel good about helping others, which is an added bonus.


## Motivation
At any given time, there are billions of people in the world who are in a worse situation than we are. Some of these individuals struggle with issues that are not their fault or are unavoidable and unchangeable. Because we are social creatures, assisting people who can't help themselves is the best way for us to progress as a species. We have a responsibility to care for others and support those who are less fortunate than we are. When we spend more money, time, or commodities, we have the chance to get better. Let's now discuss the importance that donation has.

First and foremost, donating a fantastic mood enhancer. Being able to help others is incredibly empowering, and as a result, you may feel happier and more fulfilled. Making a donation is associated with greater activity in the part of the brain that detects joy, according to research, demonstrating that the proverb "it is better to say than to receive" is indeed true. Secondly, the possibility to meet new people and broaden your social network is provided by charitable donations. This is especially true when you donate your time and share your knowledge for a good cause.

Finally, the biggest positive of donation is strengthening the global community. We're all working to improve the state of the globe. We may show our appreciation for the individuals and causes we care about throughout the holidays. A single person's contributions can benefit humanity as a whole and have a positive impact on more individuals than they may realize. Others throughout the world are not as fortunate. By raising everyone's standard of living, charitable communities contribute to a happier and healthier planet. By improving the planet, you "prepare the ground" for future generations, as well as your own inheritance.

So, we through our simple application, have created a platform for people to donate and receive, which can be used by anyone to contribute to the greate good.

## Previous demonstration

## Updated App in action

Registration with OTP and Login:
Our application provides the feature of email verification before the user register and start using the application. This helps us to provide a secure platform to donate and receive.

![register](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205829598-062d21d3-a49d-4a78-af2e-6f7ffb5c2bf2.JPG)
OTP is instantly received to the new user's given mail ID and using this the user can complete the registration process.

![OTP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205829683-17fb1e4c-314b-430e-8eb3-6189e5116bc3.JPG)
Now the user can login.

![Login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205830587-4a6eb183-bbb9-4cd0-bfad-b42e734e6854.jpg)

Marketplace:
They can look at the current marketplace to check if there are any items which pique their interest.
![marketplace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205832545-3d9c0a88-2e40-4bbb-89f1-9fcb76045bbe.jpg)

Donate an item:
Further, they can use the donate feature to donate any item at their disposal.
![donate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205831779-88b2c433-9634-4075-802b-24fdf0afabc6.jpg)

Also our application provides a history feature for the user to keep a record of their donation.
![history](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205834741-17822c4d-6d61-4338-bfc7-887e5f08c13f.jpg)

Once the user becomes a part of the donatify community, they are updated as soon as a new iten is donated on the platform through their registered mail.
![mail_notification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52947925/205835012-40c555a9-6ae4-4796-be5e-c4b9b848aca2.jpg)

## Features implemented in the update
### Improved security
Security is the biggest concern in the current world and we have taken significant steps to ensure that our application is secure from malicious users. The authorization of user to register using the OTP sent to the given mail ID by 2 step verification prevents some forms of identity theft by making sure that a captured user name/password pair cannot be used a second time.

### Secure database
We have secured the database through encyption and this helps to safeguarded from security breaches and hacking activities like firewall intrusion, virus spread, and ransomware. This helps us to protect sensitive information, which cannot be shared with outsiders at any cause.

### Versatile marketplace and notifying registered users
The user can access the newly updated marketplace to search for any items of his choice and place a request on those items which interests him. This would notify the item owner and the donation can be completed upon his choice. The item owner can dynamically update any items he had previously uploaded which can be accessed through his history. Furthermore, each registered user is notified of any new donation which are up for grabs through their registered mail.

### Request feature
Allowing the user's to requesst for the any item in the marketplace. Upon request the item owner is notified and he can take the final call on whom to donate based on their location. This helps the person who is donating to find the closest person and the other user's to place a request.

## Getting started

- ### Prerequisites
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16.X or 16.17.1) should be installed.
  - Make sure the database server (mysql) is on. Consider using XAMPP.
  - Download [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - pytest for testing the application server.

  **Frontend**: [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) (1.0.0), [antd](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) (4.23.4), [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/) (3.6.11), [react-select](https://react-select.com/home) (5.4.0), [react-tag-input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tag-input) (6.8.1), [reactstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactstrap) (9.1.4), [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

- ### Installation and Run

    **Backend**: [Documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TejasPrabhu/Donatify/blob/backendDocs/index.html)

    1. Create virtual environment

    ```
    python -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>
    ```

    2. Activate Python Virtual environment

    ```
    <name_of_virtualenv>\Scripts\activate.bat for Windows users.
    source <name_of_virtualenv>/bin/activate for linux users.
    ```

    3. Install dependencies

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

	4. Make sure the database is imported from ```src/database/donationsystem.sql``` onto the mysql server.
	
    5. Run the below command from the main directory to start the backend application server.

    ```
    python -m src.Backend.app
    ```

    6. The backend flask application will be up and running at ```localhost:5001```

    **Frontend**: [Documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TejasPrabhu/Donatify/blob/main/docs/frontendDocs/left-overs/0.1.0/index.html )

    1. After cloning the repository, move to the directory ```src\frontend``` where our frontend code is located.

    2. Install all the dependencies using npm. Command to run: ```npm install```. This will fetch the dependecies from package.json file, and install them.

    3. Start the server by using the command ```npm start```. This will run the server on port ```3000```, and the website can be accessed by going to ```http://localhost:3000/```.

    4. If credentials of a registered user are available, use them, or register a new user and interact with the website.
  
 - ### Testing

    **Backend**

    1. Run the below command from the main directory. This should run all the test cases for app.py.

    ```
    pytest
    ```
    
    **Frontend**

    1. Move to the directory ```src\frontend``` where our frontend tests are located.
    
    2. Run the tests using the command ```npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false```. This will run all the tests across the frontend code.


  - ### Troubleshooting
  
    Try the following troubleshooting steps. If none of them work, contact the repository owner/file an issue.

    **Backend**

    1. We have added the print statements in all of the backend functions to know execution of the codes.
    2. In case of error the print statements do let us know about the issue of code break.
    3. The api responses the status code, valid message and response header which they can share back for troubleshooting.

    **Frontend**
    
    1. Since frontend is build using JavaScript, React and Redux, check for console logs under developer tools to identify any failures.
    2. Consider installing and using [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) to track the request through the system.
